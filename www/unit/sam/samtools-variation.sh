# 1. Aligns the real genome against the reference.
#    Keep in mind that typically we don't know what the real genome is
#    We use it here just to see what a whole genome alignment looks like.
#
# 2. Simulate data from the real genome. This is what comes out of
#    a sequencing instrument.
#
# 3. Align the high throughput data against the reference.
#
# 4. Select and store improperly paired reads in a different file.
