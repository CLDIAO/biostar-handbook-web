A SAM file contains so called information on alignments.

### Creating SAM files

Please refer to {%  link 'short-read-aligners' %} on how to generate files.
This tutorial will assume that you have at least the `bwa.sam`  file generated
with instruction on that page.

The main program used to process SAM files is called samtools:

    samtools

Just as `bwa` (and as a matter of fact both were developed by the same author, Heng Li) samtools
takes commands like `view`:

    samtools view bwa.sam | head

This generates 10 SAM records. Scroll to the right to see all columns.

### SAM file structure

Cut out one column at the time and read what the [SAM format specification][sam-spec] states about
it.

    # First column is called QNAME (Query Name)
    samtools view bwa.sam  | cut -f 1 | head
    # SRR1972739.1
    # SRR1972739.1
    # SRR1972739.1
    # SRR1972739.2
    # SRR1972739.2

    # Second column is called FLAG
    samtools view bwa.sam | cut -f 2 | head
    # 83
    # 2115
    # 163
    # 115
    #179

    # And so on. Investigate the 11+ columns

The book version of the handbook explains in more detail what each of these flags mean.

### Sam Flags

The samtools `flags` allow us to select alignments that have certain properties.
As of samtools 1.2 there is a `flags` command to covert the integer codes to human readable output:

    # List all flags.
    samtools flags

    # It can combine the flags into a single number.
    samtools flags PAIRED,PROPER_PAIR,REVERSE,MREVERSE
    # 0x33    51    PAIRED,PROPER_PAIR,REVERSE,MREVERSE

    # It works backwards from integer number to words as well.
    samtools flags 51
    # 0x33	51	PAIRED,PROPER_PAIR,REVERSE,MREVERSE

When we filter we subselect from the alignment based on the condition.

    # How many alignments do we have
    samtools view bwa.sam | wc -l
    # 2073

    # Counting alignments is such a common operations that there
    # is a parameter -c to do it
    samtools view -c bwa.sam
    # 2073

### Converting to BAM format

The BAM conversion can be performed via:

    samtools view -b bwa.sam > bwa.bam

Samtools will works identically on BAM file as well, it will detect the
type of the file automatically:

    samtools view bwa.bam | head

Most analyses require that the BAM file is sorted by coordinates and is indexed
as well:

    samtools sort bwa.bam > bwa.sorted.bam
    samtools index bwa.sorted.bam

It is possible to create a one step conversion and sort (make sure you have samtools 1.3 or later):

    alias bam='samtools view -b - | samtools sort'

With this you can chain the `bam` command to the outputs that produce SAM formats
and bypass having the extra files:

    bwa mem $REF $R1 $R2 | bam > bwa.bam
    samtools index bwa.bam

### Filtering BAM files

To select all reads that align and are mapped to the reverse strand we do a:

	# Oppose unmapped (4) and select for reverse strand (16).
	samtools view -c -F 4 -f 16  bwa.bam
	# 651

Now to select the reads that map onto the forward strand we do:

	# Oppose unmapped (4) and oppose the reverse strand (16).
	samtools view -c -F 4 -F 16  bwa.bam
	# 898

	# The two flags can be combined into a single one:
	samtools view -c -F 20  bwa.bam
	# 898

	samtools flags 20
	# 0x14	20	UNMAP,REVERSE

### Visualize BAM files

Sorted in indexed BAM files may be visualized in tools with graphical user interfaces
for example [IGV](https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/)  or [IGB](http://bioviz.org/igb/index.html).
These tools may already have the genome of interest. If not the users need to create a custom
genome file to visualize against. Please consult the documentation on how to do that.
