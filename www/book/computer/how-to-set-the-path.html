One of the most frustrating issues faced by newcomers is how to run a program
they have just installed. Suppose you install the program `samtools` and you try
to run it you could get this:

    $ fastq-dump
    fastq-dump: command not found

The main concept to remember here is that our computers
look at only a few locations when trying to find a program. When we install
a new program we
need to tell our computer of the new locations . There are different ways to do this:

- - -

### Solution 1: Use the full program name

Run the program by its fully qualified path (location). Of course you need to know what that is.
From the software directory type `pwd` and that will tell you the full path that you can then use:

    /Users/ialbert/src/sratoolkit.2.5.2-mac64/bin/fastq-dump

we may use a shorter form when the program is in our home directory:

    ~/src/sratoolkit.2.5.2-mac64/bin/fastq-dump

If that works then we can always invoke the program by its name. It is a bit hard on eyes,
see the next solution.

### Solution 2: Extend the search PATH

It is a bit unwieldy to type the above each time.
If we wanted to be able to run the program just by typing its name say `fastq-dump` we
need instruct the computer to also look for the program in the `/Users/ialbert/src/sratoolkit.2.5.2-mac64/bin/`
directory. To do so
we need add the location of the program to the so called *search path* of the shell:

    export PATH=~/src/sratoolkit.2.5.2-mac64/bin:$PATH

The new `PATH` will be constructed as the `new directory` + `:` + `old value` of the `PATH`.
Now we should be able to run the program as

    fastq-dump

Now the above is great solution but typing thsi export command each time is tedious.
We want to apply the setting automatically. In this case you need to append this information
to the so called *shell profile*. See the page {% link "set-bash-profile.html" %}

### Solution 3: Create shortcuts

There are many cases when we only need to access a single program
and adding directories to the path is tedious and error prone.
In this case the solution is to first create
one directory and add it to the search path as in **Solution 2** above. Typically this
directoy is `~/bin`. Then
create symbolic links (shortcuts) from the programs into this `~/bin` directory.
Since the directory in already on the search path any new program added there will
also become accessible.

```bash
# Creates the ~/bin directory if it did not exists
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Link fastq-dump program into the ~/bin folder
#
# Syntax: ln -s source destination
#
ln -s ~/src/sratoolkit.2.5.2-mac64/bin/fastq-dump ~/bin/fastq-dump
```

Of course we still need to add `~/bin` to our path. But this now only needs to
be done once. After that simply linking the program into `~/bin` will make it available
everywhere. The export command simply becomes.

    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
