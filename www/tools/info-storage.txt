### Directory layout

We recommend that all tools be placed under the same directory. We recommend
to use the `~/src` for all downloaded tools. Here `~` stands for the
so called home directory that a terminal will open to. We also recommend that you
create a `~/bin` directory that is added to the execution path. This
avoids having to extend the path for each tool. We will download
and install reference genomes into the `~/refs` directory. You will
need to do the following from a terminal:

    mkdir -p ~/src
    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/refs

One of the early challenges here is that by default the Mac
OSX won't even show you the home directory that your Terminal
opens into. You will need to make sure to enable it in the
Finder. See {% link "computer-setup" %}

### Installation help

At various stages you may need to visit the following resources:

* {% link "how-to-install-everything" %} - installation instruction for every tool.
* {% link "how-to-set-the-path" %} - make your environment find the programs.
* {% link "bash-profile.html" %} - make your settings apply automatically.
* {% link "nuked-the-path.html" %} - because one day everyone does.
