### Basic concepts

Bioinformatics requires the installation of software tools that usually are distributed in
various formats:

* "binary code" that can be run directly on the target computer.
* programs that require the presence of another programming language: `java`, `python`, `ruby` or `perl`.
* source code that needs to be "compiled" to create a "binary" program.
* programs accessed via web interfaces that typically require the use of a web browser

In addition some software tools may require other additional software to be present.

### Steps that only need to be done once

There are separate instructions for Max OSX, Linux and Windows computers.
Follow only the instructions for your platform. There may be multiple steps required
to get through.

### Directory layout

We recommend that all tools be placed under the same directory. We recommend
to use the `~/src` for all downloaded tools. Here `~` stands for the
so called home directory that your Terminal will open into. We also recommend that you
create a `~/bin` directory that is added to the execution path. This
avoids having to extend the path for each tool. We will download
and install reference genomes into the `~/refs` directory. You will
need to do the following from a terminal:

    # This will store the downloaded program sources
    mkdir -p ~/src

    # This folder will store shortcuts to all tools
    mkdir -p ~/bin

    # This folder will store the reference genomes and annotations
    mkdir -p ~/refs

One of the early challenges here is that by default the Mac
OSX Finder won't even show you the home directory that your Terminal
opens into. You will need to make sure to enable it in the
Finder as described in: {% link "computer-setup" %}.
More information on how to create directories and what these commands mean
is covered in the chapter discussing the Unix operating system.

### Install a TEXT editor

Microsoft Word is **NOT** a text editor. Sooner or later it will  cause (devious) problems.
Best if you start using a proper text editor. Essential features:

* Ability to show **TAB** characters versus multiple **SPACE** characters.
  Mixing up TABS and SPACES is a very common error. Copy-pasting from a web
  page often turns a TAB into SPACE characters (yes very annoying). We need the ability
  to see the difference if necessary.
* Show line numbering. Lets us to identify the line where an error is reported.
* Switch line endings. Line endings have variants: Unix, Windows or Mac OS 9 endings.
  (Mac OSX uses Unix line endings). All files should have a  Unix line ending mode.
  Your editor needs to have the ability to convert line endings to Unix format.

Recommendation: [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) that is
available for all platforms but there
are many other options with different tradeoffs. Please download and install this editor.

**Note:** We use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and we use it for both text editing and programming
but this may be an overkill for just doing bioinformatics.
