These tasks only need to be done once for each platform.

## Mac OS X


### Install XCode

Mac OSX users need to install XCode from the AppStore. In addition users may
need also need to occasionally launch XCode manually after certain updates to agree to
changes in the license. In addition ensure that command line tools are installed with:

    xcode-select --install

### Install Homebrew

The Mac OSX instructions will use [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) whenever the tool has a corresponding
formula. Ocassionally when using `brew` the version of the software may older than the latest release.
In that case users should follow the Unix instructions on Mac OSX as well.
When using homebrew users need to tap the science formulas then
regularly update the formulas, especially after an XCode update.

Here is a list of all [science formulas](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science)

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew update

There are a number of important libraries that tools may require:

    # Install the X11 libraries. Will take a long time
    # to finish and it will ask for a root password.
    brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz

    # Installs required libraries.
    brew install gd libharu git imagemagick lzo hdf5

A library may become outdated in which case it needs to be upgraded. For example:

    brew update
    brew upgrade gd libharu git imagemagick lzo hdf5

Occasionally the `brew` command may fail to install a tool when some parts of the system do not have write access.
You will receive "permission errors" for example `/usr/local/man/ is not writable`.
In those cases you need to set write permissions to those directories with:

    sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/man/

**Note:** even when regularly updated the brewed formulas may install
older versions of the software.

### Install Java

Install [Java for Mac OS X](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml)

### Finder Preferences

To be able to view your home directory for the Mac Finder you need to tick the checkbox next to it.
My username is `ialbert`, yours will be different.

## Linux

Select a well established Linux distribution: Ubuntu

There are numerous Linux distributions with various naming schemes. To set up a system users
need to install packages via a so called package managers: `apt-get`, `yum` and others.
Depending on the Linux distribution's intial configuration one may install some, all or none of the
package shown below. Moreover the naming of these libraries occasionally changes. Please report
errors via the ticketing system. For Ubuntu Linux the following instructions were required.

    # Install a number of required libraries.
    sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential ncurses-dev byacc zlib1g-dev python-dev git cmake

    # Install java and python libraries.
    sudo apt-get install -y unzip default-jre python-pip

    # You may also need to install common perl modules that are not always included.
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install "LWP::Simple"'
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install "HTML::Entities"'

Depending on your linux distribution software may be prepackaged. Typically
however these prepackaged versions lag the current versions.  For example
you may be able to install the EMBOSS tools with:

    sudo apt-get install emboss

## Windows/Cygwin

### Install Cygwin

Ensure that you have selected all packages during installation. This is a bit counterintuitive
in the setup interface. You need to click the "plus" icon twice until all packages are selected.

### Install Java
