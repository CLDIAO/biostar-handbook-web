### How to use this page

This page lists the installation instruction for every tool in the book. The list is sorted
alphabetically. The instructions are comprehensive and can be copy pasted into a terminal.
We follow the directory layout described in {% link "software-installation-guide" %}

Note that for each installation step we show the update to the `PATH`
environment variable but don't apply it to the shell profile. See also:

* {% link "computer-setup" %}
* {% link "how-to-set-the-path.html" %}
* {% link "bash-profile.html" %}

{# the context.SETUP_FILES contains the list of files in /unit/setup/install/*.md #}
{% for name, path in context.SETUP_FILES %}

<a name="{{name}}">&nbsp;</a>
{% include path %}

{% top %}
