Bioinformatics is the science of extracting and interpreting
the information encoded in genomes.

The [Biostar Handbook][book] provides a condensed and practical
overview of the major data analysis methods
of bioinformatics. This website is an online companion of the book.

All chapters in the book have corresponding web pages that
demonstrate commands and their outputs in more detailed
manner than what was appropriate for the the book.

The content of this website may change more frequently
than there are updates to the book. The site
will be updated to correct errors, add more elegant and
efficient solutions and to expand the material.
