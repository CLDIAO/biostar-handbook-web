### Symptom

Yes, it is possible to break everything so that not even simple command works anymore.

    $ ls
    -bash: ls: command not found

Sooner or later we all do this.

### How can this happen

If you mistype the `PATH` variable while
adding it into the `.bash_profile` you may end up
with the unenviable situation of applying an incorrect
setting every time your terminal initializes. For example
on a beautiful morning you'll do a:

    echo 'export PATH=~/bin:PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

The net effect of this is that even basic system programs
that used to work before won't do so anymore:"

    $ ls
    -bash: ls: command not found

**Congratulations!** You've just nuked your `PATH`. You forgot the
`$` sign on the right hand side of the `PATH` variable. Instead
of substituting the new `PATH` with the value of `$PATH`
you are setting it to be the word `PATH`. Not so good.
Your command should have looked like this:

    echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile

Oops!

Look at the bright side: there is probably no command line guru out there that did not do
this at one point in their career. Hence you are well on your way to guru-ness. Rock on!

### A shorter explanation

Jules in [Pulp Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction) explains it best:

> The `PATH` to any righteous tool is beset on all sides by the
> inequities of `Unix` and the Tyranny of `Environment Variables`.
>
> Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
> through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper
> and the finder of lost programs.

### How to fix it

Open a terminal. Oh yes, it is still broken.

1. Fix the `PATH` within the terminal.

        export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

2. Edit your `.bash_profile` with `nano` and remove the lines that cause the trouble:

        nano ~/.bash_profile

`nano` is a bit of a quirky editor. Take it as punishment meted out for clobbering your path.
It could be worse. At least your don't have to use `vi`.

Edit the file, correct the offending line(s) then save the file
with `ctrl + O` (that is capital letter O) then exit the editor with
`ctrl + X`.

Open a NEW terminal window and verify that your "corrections" make sense.
Rinse and repeat until it works.

**Good luck comrade!**
