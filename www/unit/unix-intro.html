**Note**: Our book is not meant to be a full introduction
to the Unix command line. There are many resources you may consult.
We recommend [Unix for Biologists][unix-for-biologist] by Ian Korf.

Below we will use simple unix tools to obtain and investigate
a genome feature file that represents all the annotated features
in the yeast genome.The data is obtained from [SGD Curated Data][sgd-download]
