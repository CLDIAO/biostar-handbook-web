### Data

The test data consists of two commercially available RNA samples:

* Universal Human Reference (UHR) that contains RNA isolated from a diverse
  set of 10 cancer cell lines.
* Human Brain Reference (HBR) is total RNA isolated from the brains of 23
  Caucasians, male and female, of varying age but mostly 60-80 years old.

In addition, a spike-in control was used. An aliquot of the [ERCC ExFold
RNA Spike-In Control Mixes](https://github.com/griffithlab/rnaseq_tutorial/wiki/ResourceFiles/ERCC.pdf)
to each sample.

The spike-in consists of 92 transcripts that are present in known concentrations
across a wide abundance range (from very few copies to many copies).
Adding controls allows us to test the degree to which the RNA-seq assays
(including all laboratory and analysis steps) accurately reflect the
relative abundance of transcript species within a sample.

There are two 'mixes' of these transcripts to allow an assessment of
differential expression output between samples if we put one mix in each of
your two comparisons. In our case, Mix1 was added to the UHR sample,
and Mix2 was added to the HBR sample.

We also have **3** complete experimental replicates for each sample.

### Changes

Some of the data names and annotations files have been changed and simplified.

	# Create the reference genome directory.
	mkdir -p ~/appbio/rnaseq

	# Switch to the directory.
	cd ~/appbio/rnaseq

	# Obtain and unpack the data.
	curl -O https://www.biostarhandbook.com/static/download/rnaseq_lecture.tar.gz

	# Investigate the data
	tar xzvf rnaseq_lecture.tar.gz

Investigate the downloaded archive. Look at the directory structure and file naming convetions.
There are sequencing reads, references and annotations.
