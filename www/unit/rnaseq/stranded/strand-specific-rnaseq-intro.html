Download the run information for paper

	esearch -db sra -query PRJNA127357  | efetch -format runinfo > runinfo.txt

Investigate what we know about the runs:

	cat runinfo.txt | tabtk cut -d csv -f 1,7,12,16,17

It produces the following information

	Run	avgLength	LibraryName	LibraryLayout	InsertSize
	SRR059162	76	GSM542247: RNA Ligation	SINGLE	0
	SRR059163	76	GSM542248: Illumina RNA Ligation	SINGLE	0
	SRR059164	76	GSM542248: Illumina RNA Ligation	SINGLE	0
	SRR059165	76	GSM542249: Illumina RNA Ligation - SPRI	SINGLE	0
	SRR059166	76	GSM542249: Illumina RNA Ligation - SPRI	SINGLE	0
	SRR059167	102	GSM542250: SMART	PAIRED	144

How big is the yeast genome?

	samtools faidx ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa
	cat ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa.fai |awk '{sum += $2; print sum/10^6, "million" }' | tail -1

produces

	12.1571 million

How many reads N with lenght `L=76` bp would produce `10x` coverage?

	C = N * L / G

hence

	N = C * G / L

That can be computed as:

	echo '10 * 12 / 76' | bc -l

`N = 1.5 million` reads. But the transcriptome is much shorter than the genome and in addition
it expresses at different rates. Let's estimate the transcript size. Get the same data as displayed in IGV.

	# Download the tab formatted data from UCSC.
	curl http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/database/sgdGene.txt.gz | gunzip -c > sgdGene.txt

	# We can turn that into a BED file.
	cat sgdGene.txt | awk  ' {OFS="\t"; print $3,$5,$6,$2,0,$4 } ' > genes.bed

	# Compute the running lenght of transcriptome
	bedtools merge -i genes.bed | awk '{ sum=sum + $3 - $2; print sum } ' | tail -1

with the new transcript size `G=8.9` million so the 10x average coverage leads to `N = 1.2 million` reads.
The difference here is not radical because the yeast genome is tightly packed with genes, higher order eukaryotes
usually have a more sparse genome.

Download the data, 1 million reads from two experiments one is RNA Ligation the other dUTP library preparation.

	# This dataset is an RNA Ligation method.
	fastq-dump -X 1000000 --split-files SRR059163

	# This dataset is a dUTP method.
	fastq-dump -X 1000000 --split-files SRR059176

Check what the experiments say:

	cat runinfo.txt | tabtk cut -d csv -f 1,7,12,16,17

Since we want to display in IGV we need to download the same yeast genome file to align against

	#
	# Download the sacCer3 genome build that is available inside IGV
	#
	mkdir -r ~/refs/sc

	# Download the file, uncompress and concatenate into one file.
	curl http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/sacCer3/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz | tar xzvf > ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa

	# Index the yeast genome file.
	bwa index ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa

Generate the alignments:

	# Bam file conversion.
	alias bam='samtools view -b - | samtools sort -o - booyah'

	# The first experiment is RNA ligation.
	bwa mem ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa SRR059163_1.fastq | bam > RNA_Ligation.bam
	samtools index RNA_Ligation.bam

The second experiment is with dUTP. This is a paired end run but we'll run just the first file
what it would look like if it were single end run.

	bwa mem ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa SRR059176_1.fastq | bam > dUTP_SE.bam
	samtools index dUTP_SE.bam

**Note**: This method produces data from the strand opposite to the transcript.

Finally we'll run the dUTP data in paired end mode.

	bwa mem ~/refs/sc/sacCer3.fa SRR059176_1.fastq SRR059176_2.fastq | bam > dUTP_PE.bam
	samtools index dUTP_PE.bam

The paired end stranded RNA-Seq is harder to read but still easy to tell. Watch the read towards the
ends of transcripts. What orientation are they?

### RNA-Seq coverages

	# Need to turn it into a BED file so that bedtools can use it as file B
	bedtools bamtobed -i RNA_Ligation.bam -split > RNA_Ligation.bed

	# Computes the coverage of file B over file A
	bedtools coverage -a genes.bed -b RNA_Ligation.bed > RNA_Ligation_coverage.txt

Our BED file has six columns, the coverage tool adds four more (see bedtools coverage help):
After each entry in A, reports:

1. The number of features in B that overlapped the A interval (Ni).
2. The number of bases in A that had non-zero coverage.
3. The length of the entry in A (Li).
4. The fraction of bases in A that had non-zero coverage.

Sort by the 7th column to get the genes with the highest read counts.

	cat RNA_Ligation_coverage.txt | sort -k7,7 -rn | head

### Computing RPKM, TMP

The RPKM formula for gene `Gi` is `10^9 * Ni/Li/N` the TMP formula is `10^6* Ni/Li/T`

The 7th column is the coverage. Lets make a file with Gene, Counts, RPKM and TPM. But first we need to estimate
the total transcript size = Sum(Ni/Li). How many aligned reads do we have?

	samtools view -c -F 4 RNA_Ligation.bam
	# Gives us N = 908321

The coverage file contains the `Ni` and `Li` numbers, this gives us `T`:

	cat RNA_Ligation_coverage.txt | awk '{ frac=$7/$9; sum += frac; print "T =", sum }' | tail -1
	# T = 1359.17

Fill in the RPKM and TMP numbers:

	# columns: gene name, gene length, count, RPKM, TPM
	cat RNA_Ligation_coverage.txt | awk '{ OFS="\t"; N=908321; T=1339; print $4, $9, $7, 10^9 * $7/$9/N, 10^6 * $7/$9/T } ' > expression.txt

You can now sort `expression.txt` by `counts`, `RPKM` or `TPM`:

	# Genes with highest TPM
 	cat expression.txt | sort -k 5,5 -rn | head
