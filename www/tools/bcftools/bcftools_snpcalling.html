The pileup format is a data representation that is generated from a SAM/BAM file and
shows nucleotides covering a single coordinate.

### Poor man's snp caller

A "poor man's snp caller" is a simple "toy" SNP caller that can be used to distinguish "easy" to call SNPs
from difficult to predict ones. There are millions of variations that one could
detect by parsing the mipileup output. The purpose of the poor man's SNP caller is to separate SNPS
into triviailly easy and difficult ones. Then evaluate other SNP callers on their ability to work
out the difficult problems.

Place this code into `poor_man_snp.awk`

{%  simplecode "poor_man_snp.awk" %}

Run the snp caller as so:

```
samtools mpileup -f $REF experiment.bam | tr -d '$^],.' | awk -f poor_man_snp.awk > snps.bed
```
