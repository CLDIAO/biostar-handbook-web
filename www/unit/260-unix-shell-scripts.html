Shell scripts are the lab-books of a data analytics.
They are meant to store and preserve the actions performed during an
analysis procedure.

### Writing scripts

Documenting scripts is essential:

* What is the purpose of the script?
* What type of inputs it takes?
* What type of output it produces?

A script is a file that can be run from the command line. For example:

    bash sra-download.sh

Where the contents of `sra-download.sh` is:


{% code "unit/code/sra-download.sh" %}
