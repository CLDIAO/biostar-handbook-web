#### Shell initialization

The need to have certain settings applied
automatically when a terminal is opened is very common.
It is achieved by creating a file with a special name
placed in the home directory. All the commands listed
in this so called *shell profile** file will be applied when
a new shell is initialized.

Alas there are complications. As it turns out there are multiple
files that could be loaded and due to historical reasons
there is a priority of order in which files may be loaded
if they exists. The names of the files that you should
use are:

* `.bash_profile` on Mac OSX
* `.bashrc` on Linux and Cygwin

Note that both of these need to be in your home directory: `~/.bash_profile`

The file may already exists on your system if not you need
to create them. If the files exists make sure to edit
and append to them.

To add to the mysery Mac OSX will
hide the file from your view because the name starts with a period
`.` and traditionally in UNIX that indicates that the file should be
*hidden*

To edit the file in a text editor on a Mac OSX you need
to either reconfigure the Finder via an arcane incantation or
(and this is easier) create a shortcut with a different name to the file.

    # This creates your bash profile if it did not exist.
    touch ~/.bash_profile

    # Create a non-hidden shortcut to the profile file
    ln -s ~/.bash_profile ~/bash_profile

Note that editing the file will not apply these settings
to terminals that have arealy been opened. The file
is read only once on startup. New terminals will inherit
the settings but an old terminal needs to be *sourced*
to the settings like so:

    source ~/.bash_profile

#### A Minimal bash profile

Below is what we consider a minimal bash configuration file
that is still universally useful.

As you gain more expertise expand the file with commands
that are useful in your work. Here is where you would add
`PATH` settings.

{% code "unix/profile-example.sh" %}

*Note*: do yourself a favor and customize the way
the terminal looks. You can vary font sizes, colors. It makes
a tremendous difference.

* {% link "how-to-set-the-path" %} - to ensure that your environment finds the tools.
