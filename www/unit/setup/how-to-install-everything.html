### How to use this page

This page lists the installation instruction for every tool in the book.
The instructions are comprehensive and can be copy pasted into a terminal.
We follow the directory layout described in {% link "software-installation-guide" %}

Note that for each installation step we show the update command to the `PATH`
command but we won't apply it permanently to your shell profile.
There are many ways to make use of these profiles and there is no universal way to
apply the change for everyone. See the links on top for information on where to place this command
to have it loaded automatically.

    cd ~/src
    curl -O http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.3.zip
    unzip fastqc_v0.11.3.zip

    # Link the fastqc executable to the ~/bin folder that
    # you have already added to the path.
    ln -sf ~/src/FastQC/fastqc ~/bin/fastqc

    # Due to what seems a packaging error
    # the executable flag on the fastqc program is not set.
    # We need to set it ourselves.
    chmod +x ~/bin/fastqc

    # The FastQC/Configuration directory contains a number of files
    # of interest that can be customized if needed.

## EDirect

Entrez Direct consist of a suite of sripts written in the Perl language that can
be used to connect to the NCBI Entrez data interfaces.
The suite includes commands that coresponds to each of the Entrez API endpoints:
`esearch`, `efetch`, `elink`, `efilter`, `epost`, `einfo` as well as a tool called `xtract`
that can be used to extract elements of an XML document.

    brew update
    brew info edirect
    brew install edirect

    cd ~/src
    curl ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/edirect.zip -O
    unzip edirect.zip

    # This is a suite of tools thus is best to
    # add the entire directory to the search path.
    export PATH=~/src/edirect:$PATH

    # The tools that can be run are visible in source folder.
    ls ~/src/edirect

Test installation by running:

## Trimmomatic

Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina paired-end
and single ended data.  The software requires java to operate.

Website: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic

Publication: [Bolger, A. M., Lohse, M., & Usadel, B. (2014).
Trimmomatic: A flexible trimmer for Illumina Sequence Data. Bioinformatics][trimmomatic].

[trimmomatic]: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/15/2114

**Works on all platforms that support java**

    cd ~/src
    curl -O http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.33.zip
    unzip Trimmomatic-0.33.zip

    # The program can be invoked via
    java -jar ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.33/trimmomatic-0.33.jar

    # To shorten the invocation above we can use command aliases or write a shell script.

    # Creating an alias.
    alias trimmomatic='java -jar ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.33/trimmomatic-0.33.jar'

    # Creating a shell script under ~/bin/trimmomatic
    # This will be a shell script that passes all command line
    # parameters to the java program with the $@ construct
    echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/bin/trimmomatic
    echo 'java -jar ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.33/trimmomatic-0.33.jar $@' >> ~/bin/trimmomatic

    # make the shell script executable
    chmod +x ~/bin/trimmomatic

    # The ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.33/adapters/ directory contains
    # Illumina specific adapter sequences.
    ls ~/src/Trimmomatic-0.33/adapters/

Test installation by running:

    trimmomatic
