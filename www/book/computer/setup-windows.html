There is a ray of hope on the horizon.

Apparently Windows 10 will soon support running Linux based software.
At that point Windows will be fully functional in bioinformatics.

Until then various workarounds are required.
Typically these involve either running [Cygwin][cygwin], Linux-like environment for Windows or a full Linux
emulator like [VirtualBox][virtualbox].

### Install Cygwin

When installing cygwin ensure that you have the following packages selected:

* git
* make
* gcc-g++
* openssh
* zlib

(todo)

### Install Java

Install [Java JDK for Mac OS X](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

Make sure that you install the **JDK** (Java Development Kit) and not the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment)
version of Java.
